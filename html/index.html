<p>
Considering the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden'>recent 
confirmations</a> regarding the 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four'>Orwellian environment</a>
Internet-based communication is apparently happening in, it's time to think about 
alternative ways of communication which do not involve the Internet. 
With current technology in place, which alternatives are there?
</p>

<!--
<h2>The ways of the internet</h2>

While offering a multitude of advantages, Internet-based communication is generally 
subject to a couple of restrictions:

<ul>

<li>
Relying on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider'>ISPs</a>, 
communication can be <b>traced back to the individual user</b> at a later time. <br />
This means you may have to justify your communication actions at any point in the 
future, possibly in a different context. Uncovering a wrong which your country is 
involved in? You might think again.
</li>

<li>
Attribution is even easier when <b>a user account is required</b> to communicate, as 
is the case with Skype, Facebook, Google+, etc.
</li>

<li>
Internet-based communication uses <b>infrastructure which is in control of the 
government</b>. While this is not a problem <i>per se</i>, there have been several 
recent incidents where a government decided to disable communication. 
</li>

</ul>
-->

<h2>Local, broadcast-style communication</h2>

<p>
<b>Ahoy!</b> is an App which allows for local, broadcast-style communication 
using WiFi access point names (more specifically: 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSID#Service_set_identification_.28SSID.29'>
SSIDs</a>). 
The App runs in the background, keeps looking for nearby WiFi access points, filters out 
messages and notifies the user whenever a new message is found.
In addition to that, the user may specify a message for broadcasting and the App will 
take care of setting up a WiFi hotspot with a corresponding SSID representing the message.
</p>

<p>
While this approach allows for very short messages only &ndash; so short, in fact, 
that it makes Tweets look verbose in comparison &ndash; it has a number of 
interesting properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication is <b>inherently local</b>. 
This means that when you go somewhere, and there's a message in the air, it refers 
to where you currently are. 
Relevance is defined by where you are right now, not by who you're following on 
Twitter, which Facebook groups you're in, or who's in your Google+ Circles.</li>
<li>Communication is <b>anonymous</b>.</li>
<li>Messages <b>do not travel</b> accross the Internet, therefore:</li>
<ul>
<li>Messages <b>can not be monitored</b> from far away.</li>
<li>Broadcasting messages is <b>robust towards Internet blackouts</b>. 
<br />
However, broadcasting can be inhibited locally using a WiFi jammer.</li>
<li>Broadcasting messages is <b>free</b>.</li>
</ul>
<li>There are <b>no accounts</b> or personal information.</li>
<li>Messages are <b>volatile</b>.</li>
<li>The entire idea is probably <b>non-marketable</b>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<dl>
<dt>
How big is the range?
</dt>
<dd>
A normal WiFi adapter can be recognized up to 100 feet (30 meters) away when used outside.
</dd>
<dt>
That's not very far!
</dt>
<dd>
And that's not a question. However, you can increase the range of a message by 
repeating it: click the message and press the button on the right 
(<img src='social_share.png' style='margin-left: 0.2em; margin-right: 0.2em; height: 16px; background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 3px; position: relative; top: 3px;'/>)
to repeat the message. If the same message is detected several times, the number is 
indicated on top of the signal level indicator:<br />
<img src='message-counts.png' style='margin-top: 0.2em; border-radius: 4px;' />
</dd>
<dt>
Isn't it a risk having your WiFi hotspot activated all the time while broadcasting 
a message?
</dt>
<dd>
No, it's not. When you broadcast a message, your WiFi hotspot gets secured with a 
random key, and the key is changed once per minute.
</dd>
<dt>
Why can't some special characters be entered? What about non-English speaking countries?
</dt>
<dd>
As of today, SSIDs must consist of printable ASCII characters (mostly a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and 
a couple of special characters). A handful of special characters are not allowed and on
top of that, some mobile phones cut off SSIDs after certain characters.
</dd>
<dt>
Is there a version for iPhones and the like?
</dt>
<dd>
No, unfortunately, there's not. And I'm afraid it might not be possible in the near 
future to create one due to Apple's 
<a href='http://www.cultofmac.com/32289/apple-is-purging-the-app-store-of-wi-fi-stumblers/'>strict</a>
<a href='http://www.imore.com/apple-removing-wifi-scanning-apps-app-store'>policies</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
Can we see some screenshots?

<h2>Technical details</h2>

<h3>Message encoding</h3>

<p>
In order to be able to distinguish a message from a legitimate SSID access point name,
a message is prepended with a backtick: <tt>&#96;</tt>. 
Every SSID starting with a backtick is assumed to be a message.
</p>

<!--
<p>
In order to be able to distinguish a message from a legitimate SSID access point name,
the following encoding is used:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The maximum SSID length is assumed to be 31 characters to allow for 
null-termination of the string.</li>
<li>The maximum length of a message is 30 characters which allows for prepending the 
message with a backtick (<tt>&#96;</tt>).</li>
<li>If there is still characters left in the SSID (if the message length is 29 
characters or less), the remaining space gets filled up with the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>a closing backtick,</li>
<li>if there is still space, up to three checksum characters (resulting in a lower 
false discovery rate for messages).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The checksum is calculated as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>From the raw ASCII character seqeuence, a 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC32'>CRC32 checksum</a> is calculated 
according to <a href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt'>RFC 1952</a> and 
<a href='http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V.42-200203-I/en'>ITU-T recommendation V.42</a>.
The App uses the <tt>java.util.zip.CRC32</tt> class.
</li>
<li>
The result of this calculation is a 32 bit number which is then converted to a 
big-endian string representation using the alphanumeric characters <tt>0</tt>-<tt>9</tt>, 
<tt>A</tt>-<tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>a</tt>-<tt>z</tt> (62 characters in total).
</li>
<li>
From the resulting string, up to three characters are appended as the checksum, 
resulting in a false discovery rate of 1.6%, 0.03%, and 0.0004% for checksum lengths of 
1, 2, and 3, respecitvely (among all SSIDs which are enclosed in backticks).
</li>
</ul>
