<h3>Establish new language packs</h3>

<p>
Ahoy! uses different language packs to enable long messages regardless of the 
language they're written in (well, not <em>that</em> long, but still longer than the 
few characters provided by the UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings).
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to help, please have a look at the <a href='languages.html'>languages 
page</a> and check whether the language pack for your language needs feedback from
native speakers like you!
</p>
