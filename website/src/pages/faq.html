What is the maximum length of a message?
</dt>
<dd>
The maximum message length is generally around 45 &ndash; 55 characters if a language 
pack is available for the message, otherwise UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding is used, resulting
in around 20 characters or 10 characters for Asian languages.
While a message is being entered, a yellow progress bar below the input field shows 
how much capacity is still left.
If a language pack for your native language is not yet available, you can help to

Which language packs are available?
</dt>
<dd>
Support for various languages is prepared. However, feedback from native speakers is
required for many languages before message lengths can be increased. Check the 
<a href='languages.html'>languages page</a> to see if your input is required.

How big is the broadcast range?

<dd>
A normal WiFi adapter can be recognized up to 100 feet (30 meters) away when used outside.

That's not very far!
</dt>
<dd>
And that's not a question. However, you can increase the range of a message by 
repeating it: click the message and press the button on the right 
(<img src='include/social_share.png' style='margin-left: 0.2em; margin-right: 0.2em; height: 16px; background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 3px; position: relative; top: 3px;'/>)
to repeat the message. If the same message is detected several times, the number is 
indicated on top of the signal level indicator:<br />

Isn't it a risk having your WiFi hotspot activated all the time while broadcasting 
a message?
</dt>
<dd>
No, it's not. When you broadcast a message, your WiFi hotspot gets secured with a 
random key, and the key is changed once per minute.

Why does my phone keep switching the access point off and on every minute when I 
broadcast a message?
</dt>
<dd>
Apparently, it is not possible for an Android phone to scan for nearby access points
while acting as an access point. Therefore, broadcasting gets temporarily disabled
while the device scans for messages, which happens every 60 seconds on average when you
are broadcasting a message. 
If you are not broadcasting anything, a WiFi scan is carried out roughly every 30 
seconds.

Is there a version for Apple's iPhone?
</dt>
<dd>
No, unfortunately, there's not. And I'm afraid it might not be possible in the near 
future to create one due to Apple's
