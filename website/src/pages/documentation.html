<h3>Message encoding</h3>

<p>
In order to be able to distinguish a message from a legitimate SSID access point name,
a message is prepended with a backtick: <tt>&#96;</tt>. 
Every SSID starting with a backtick is assumed to be a message.
</p>

<p>
In order to be able to distinguish a message from a legitimate SSID access point name,
the following encoding is used:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The maximum SSID length is assumed to be 31 characters to allow for 
null-termination of the string.</li>
<li>The maximum length of a message is 30 characters which allows for prepending the 
message with a backtick (<tt>&#96;</tt>).</li>
<li>If there is still characters left in the SSID (if the message length is 29 
characters or less), the remaining space gets filled up with the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>a closing backtick,</li>
<li>if there is still space, up to three checksum characters (resulting in a lower 
false discovery rate for messages).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The checksum is calculated as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>From the raw ASCII character seqeuence, a 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRC32'>CRC32 checksum</a> is calculated 
according to <a href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt'>RFC 1952</a> and 
<a href='http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V.42-200203-I/en'>ITU-T recommendation V.42</a>.
The App uses the <tt>java.util.zip.CRC32</tt> class.
</li>
<li>
The result of this calculation is a 32 bit number which is then converted to a 
big-endian string representation using the alphanumeric characters <tt>0</tt>-<tt>9</tt>, 
<tt>A</tt>-<tt>Z</tt>, and <tt>a</tt>-<tt>z</tt> (62 characters in total).
</li>
<li>
From the resulting string, up to three characters are appended as the checksum, 
resulting in a false discovery rate of 1.6%, 0.03%, and 0.0004% for checksum lengths of 
1, 2, and 3, respecitvely (among all SSIDs which are enclosed in backticks).
</li>
</ul>
