<p>
Considering the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden'>recent 
confirmations</a> regarding the 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four'>Orwellian environment</a>
that Internet-based communication is apparently happening in, it's time to think about 
alternative ways of communication which do not involve the Internet. 
With current technology in place, which alternatives are there?
</p>

<!--
<h2>The ways of the internet</h2>

While offering a multitude of advantages, Internet-based communication is generally 
subject to a couple of restrictions:

<ul>

<li>
Relying on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider'>ISPs</a>, 
communication can be <b>traced back to the individual user</b> at a later time. <br />
This means you may have to justify your communication actions at any point in the 
future, possibly in a different context. Uncovering a wrong which your country is 
involved in? You might think again.
</li>

<li>
Attribution is even easier when <b>a user account is required</b> to communicate, as 
is the case with Skype, Facebook, Google+, etc.
</li>

<li>
Internet-based communication uses <b>infrastructure which is in control of the 
government</b>. While this is not a problem <i>per se</i>, there have been several 
recent incidents where a government decided to disable communication. 
</li>

</ul>
-->

<h2>Local message broadcasts</h2>

<p>
<b>Ahoy</b> is an Android App which allows for local, broadcast-style communication.
You can broadcast a message using your phone and people around you will be able to see 
the message on their phones. They, too, can broadcast messages or choose to repeat your
message to extend its range.
</p>

<p>
Messages are compressed and encoded as WiFi access point names 
(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSID#Service_set_identification_.28SSID.29'>SSIDs</a>). 
While this approach allows for very short messages only &ndash; so short, in fact, 
that it makes Tweets look verbose in comparison &ndash; it has a number of 
interesting properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication is <b>inherently local</b>. 
This means that when you go somewhere, and there's a message in the air, it refers 
to where you currently are. 
Relevance is defined by where you are right now, not by who you're following on 
Twitter, which Facebook groups you're in, or who's in your Google+ Circles.</li>
<li>Communication is <b>anonymous</b>*. <br />
<span style='font-size: 90%;'>(*) Well, anonymity only goes so far. Although there's no user 
accounts and it's just local radio, your WiFi adapter's MAC address still gets broadcasted.
If that's a problem for you, use a rooted phone to change your MAC address. Hopefully, a 
future version of Ahoy will facilitate MAC spoofing on a rooted phone. If you like to take 
things to eleven, always keep moving to foil triangulation attempts.</span>
</li>
<li>Messages <b>do not travel</b> accross the Internet, therefore:</li>
<ul>
<li>Messages <b>can not be monitored</b> from far away.</li>
<li>Broadcasting messages is <b>robust towards Internet outages</b>. 
<br />
However, broadcasting can be inhibited locally using a WiFi jammer.</li>
<li>Broadcasting messages is <b>free</b>.</li>
</ul>
<li>It even works <b>without a SIM card</b>.</li>
<li>There are <b>no accounts</b> or personal information.</li>
<li>Messages are <b>volatile</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Message lengths</h2>

<p>
Although in practice, SSID may only contain a handful of ASCII characters, Ahoy can be
used to send messages in any language, using any script defined by 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode'>Unicode</a>. 
However, message lengths vary depending on the language a message is written in. 
Specialized language packs which employ 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding'>Huffman coding</a> are used to
maximize message lengths for most languages, resulting in message lengths of 45 to 55 
characters on average. 
Ahoy chooses the most compact encoding automatically, falling back to UTF-8 or UTF-16 
if no appropriate language pack is available.
