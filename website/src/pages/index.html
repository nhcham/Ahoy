<p>
Considering the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden'>recent 
confirmations</a> regarding the 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four'>Orwellian environment</a>
Internet-based communication is apparently happening in, it's time to think about 
alternative ways of communication which do not involve the Internet. 
With current technology in place, which alternatives are there?
</p>

<!--
<h2>The ways of the internet</h2>

While offering a multitude of advantages, Internet-based communication is generally 
subject to a couple of restrictions:

<ul>

<li>
Relying on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider'>ISPs</a>, 
communication can be <b>traced back to the individual user</b> at a later time. <br />
This means you may have to justify your communication actions at any point in the 
future, possibly in a different context. Uncovering a wrong which your country is 
involved in? You might think again.
</li>

<li>
Attribution is even easier when <b>a user account is required</b> to communicate, as 
is the case with Skype, Facebook, Google+, etc.
</li>

<li>
Internet-based communication uses <b>infrastructure which is in control of the 
government</b>. While this is not a problem <i>per se</i>, there have been several 
recent incidents where a government decided to disable communication. 
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Local, broadcast-style communication</h2>

<p>
<b>Ahoy</b> is an Android App which allows for local, broadcast-style communication 
using WiFi access point names (more specifically: 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSID#Service_set_identification_.28SSID.29'>
SSIDs</a>). 
The App runs in the background, keeps looking for nearby WiFi access points, filters out 
messages and notifies the user whenever a new message is found.
In addition to that, the user may specify a message for broadcasting and the App will 
take care of setting up a WiFi hotspot with a corresponding SSID representing the message.
</p>

<p>
While this approach allows for very short messages only &ndash; so short, in fact, 
that it makes Tweets look verbose in comparison &ndash; it has a number of 
interesting properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication is <b>inherently local</b>. 
This means that when you go somewhere, and there's a message in the air, it refers 
to where you currently are. 
Relevance is defined by where you are right now, not by who you're following on 
Twitter, which Facebook groups you're in, or who's in your Google+ Circles.</li>
<li>Communication is <b>anonymous</b>.</li>
<li>Messages <b>do not travel</b> accross the Internet, therefore:</li>
<ul>
<li>Messages <b>can not be monitored</b> from far away.</li>
<li>Broadcasting messages is <b>robust towards Internet outages</b>. 
<br />
However, broadcasting can be inhibited locally using a WiFi jammer.</li>
<li>Broadcasting messages is <b>free</b>.</li>
</ul>
<li>It even works <b>without a SIM card</b>.</li>
<li>There are <b>no accounts</b> or personal information.</li>
<li>Messages are <b>volatile</b>.</li>
<li>The entire idea is probably <b>non-marketable</b>.</li>
</ul>
